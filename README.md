# Esolang Interpreters
Python implementations of different esoteric programming languages.

## Implemented
-   [ASCII art](https://esolangs.org/wiki/ASCII_art) (50 lines)
-   [circlefuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Circlefuck) (70 lines)
    - Note: The `quine` and `narcissist` programs are the only ones that don't work. The `Quine` program doesn't work because the program modifies a left square bracket, causing an infinite loop. My plan is to fix this by introducing a stack that keeps track of bracket positions.

## Future Implementations
- `None`
