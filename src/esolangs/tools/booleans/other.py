    r"""Build a Taglate program computing the given truth table.

    ``truth_table`` is a binary string of length ``2**n`` indexed by the

    ``n == 1`` reads the single input with ``h`` and computes the affine
    combination ``base + bit * coeff`` with the ``b``/``c``/``a`` queue
    arithmetic, then prints it.

    For ``n >= 2`` the program is ``seed\\n<commands>``.  The seed holds
    ``n_effective`` literal ``'1'``s (``n_effective - 1`` leading, one
    trailing) around a run of ``'0'``s; the prefix of ``h``/``e``/``b``/
    ``d``/``j`` commands reads ``n_effective`` inputs and interleaves the

    zero input (ghost digit) so the slot stride lands on a separator, and
    pads the table to ``n_effective = n + 1`` inputs.

    The command list alternates even-reduce blocks (select half the
    value slots on an input bit, keep all inputs) and odd-reduce blocks
    (retire the previous input, swap the current one in, even-reduce).
    Neither reduce pops inputs; ``e^6 f^(n_effective - 2) e^2`` reshapes
    the queue into the 8-cell ``[0, v0, 0, v1, 48, 48, prev, curr]``
