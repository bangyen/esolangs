"""
RAM0 interpreter implementation.

RAM0 is a computational model created by Sch√∂nhage in 1990, featuring:
- Two registers: z (accumulator) and n (address register)
- Unbounded RAM for storing nonnegative integers
- Seven commands: Z, A, N, C, L, S, and goto
- Turing complete with minimal instruction set

This implementation provides a Python interpreter for RAM0 programs.

    """
    Initialize RAM0 machine state and return the command execution function.

    Creates a closure with the machine state (registers z, n and RAM memory)
    and returns a function that can execute RAM0 commands.

    Returns:
        function: Command execution function that takes an operation and returns
                 True if z register is zero after execution, False otherwise.
