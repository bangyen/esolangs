# Roadmap

Only live work belongs here. Contracts and standing walls go to
[limitations](limitations.md); a closed row leaves, and its commit is the record.

## New interpreters

The candidate list is empty.

## Conditional follow-up

- **Linear Boolean generators.**  Make build time and emitted size O(T), where
  T is the truth-table length.  For each remaining generator, either add a
  loop-less O(T) construction and an executed scaling regression, or record a
  structural proof that the language or required encoding forces super-linear
  output and continue with the next generator.  Generation time includes
  choosing an input order and writing the result.

  The bar for membership: a language stays while its generator is O(T)
  on all four axes under the conventions, or its row carries a proved
  language lower bound, or its generator is a construction whose open
  cells carry an executed obstruction -- a semantic model of the language
  that every construction tried has broken on, pinned as tests.  A lookup
  table in a language's syntax is not a generator -- any language can be
  brute-forced -- so a row whose generator is one carries a clock: one
  more executed round, and if neither a construction nor a bound comes of
  it the language leaves with its row.  A wall that has not been proved is
  not a lookup table.

  All 59 generators are audited on four axes.  Totality is the `proofs.md`
  ledger's own label (`Cap`: refuses some tables on cost; `Exception`: no
  totality argument).  Output size is the registry-wide contract
  (`tests/proofs/deep/linearity.py`, per-entry cost to n=12).  Generation
  time and execution time are measured by hand: the fitted growth per
  added input over the top five arities, best of three, execution on the
  worst sampled parity row with loading excluded, and a figure on a run
  under ten milliseconds is not read as an exponent.  A row is present
  while any axis is open and leaves when all four close; an n=8 -> 9
  ratio near 2 is not evidence of O(T), so every verdict reads in one
  direction only.  Closure requires a lower bound over every program in
  the language under the generator contract.  Super-linear output implies
  super-linear generation time; the time column is not an independent
  verdict there, but a linear output can still be built super-linearly.
  The live audit is:

  | Language | Totality | Generation time | Output size | Execution time |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Factor | Total | Language lower bound | Language lower bound | Linear |
  | Polynomial | Cap | Language lower bound | Language lower bound | Linear |

  Generation time, growth per added input at the top arity: B-tapemark,
  6-5, Forth, Circuit Diagram past its n=8 route change, and Vandevelo
  (x2.0 dense over n=11..15, 0.31 s at n=12, a peel that keeps its
  working sets across cubes) read x2.0--2.2, between the size contract's
  x2.15 and what these arities separate from noise; they are held linear
  until a wider measurement says otherwise.

- **Boolean generator conventions.**  Five conventions govern the *embed*,
  the text that stands for one input -- not the program around it.  A
  template has one ordered run per input, constant width, no padded spaces,
  and a uniform `(zero, one)` pair.
  | Language | No spaces | Uniform |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  `tests/proofs/test_conventions.py` checks these on dense and parity tables
  at n=2..6. The table is empty; add a relaxed-width toggle only for a smaller
  executed build. A space toggle has no remaining use.
- **ArrowQueue reusable drain.** Ship it only if folding is testable at `n >= 5`.

- **Reorder ArrowQueue inputs.**  The three-input screen leaves 12.4%
  headroom, but its queued inputs cannot be renamed in place.  Find a
  re-enqueue and grid-routing construction, then compare emitted, executed
  programs against the current template; abandon it if the routing spends
  the apparent gain.
