# Limitations and contracts

Standing contracts and walls. Closed scaling work belongs in its commit;
Polynomial's proved wall is in [polynomial](polynomial.md).

## Interpreter conventions

- Empty input is a no-op unless a language requires a seed or grid.
- Exhausted input raises `EOFError`; malformed programs raise `ValueError`;
  runtime failure raises `HaltError`, unless the language says otherwise.
- Character input is line-delimited; a blank line means `0` by package
  convention, not language inference.
- Explicit frame stacks are uncapped. Forbin expression calls retain their
  documented host-recursion limit.
- Streetcode's four-way junction is an implementation convention: the source
  specifies only a two-road choice.

## Source positions

`esolangs debug --tui` marks only a source position. `ip_shape` is `offset`,
`grid`, `line`, or `opaque` -- `tests/test_vm_protocol.py` sweeps every language
and refuses an undeclared or misspelled value. Opaque positions have no program
mark.

Line extraction accepts anti-aliased PNGs only when strokes retain a connected
dark core. The 3px scan fixture executes addition; a one-third-pixel shift of
a 1px stroke is rejected with 921 unaccounted pixels rather than silently
changing the program.

## Boolean generators

Parameterized generators embed each input exactly once. Every emitted
character is build work. Reordering is optional around a construction, but
its selection cost counts; named candidates are capped at four and the generic
greedy scorer stops at n=10. Generator constructions may not use BFS or DFS;
test-only oracles may.

The screen script measures permuted-table builds, not an admissible reorder
under a fixed input template and fill mapping. Dig, Flowchart,
BrainIf, Sophie, and SLOW ACV MAMMALIAN must read streams in order; BF-PDA uses
its fixed stack order. No instruction-only wire is derived for 123 or Minifuck.
ArrowQueue re-enqueue remains open.

| Generator | Dense | Parity | Limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Polynomial | 10 | 10 | 1,934-instruction guard; dense n=11 is priced at 267 s and >100 MB. |

Polynomial's mandatory root product has minimum mass at the product itself;
the slack certificate proves `Theta(L**2 log L) = Theta(T**2 / log T)` digits
for every multiple, cofactor, and operand sign. Factor has a language floor
`Omega(T log T / log log T)` because exponents are unary-priced and primes are
distinct and ascending; its folded tree is `Theta(T log T)`.

### Scaling

Size is measured from rendered output, and correctness claims require running
the generated program. Execution measurements exclude loading and use the
worst sampled parity row. A sub-10 ms run does not establish an exponent.
Loading dominates Factor (integer factorization) and Circuit Diagram (parsing
super-linear area); it is intentionally excluded from execution time.

The execution contract in `tests/proofs/deep/execution.py` holds every
generator's command count linear. Bracket matching is precomputed at load.
Persistent stores use shared 32-cell chunks; RAM0 also indexes addresses.
Those choices prevent repeated scans, but command cost and source size remain
separate axes.

## Curation

The collection has 59 languages; its floor is 31. Ordinary imperative entries
with shared-shim generators and no consumer were removed. Nopstacle and
ZTOALC L left: the former cannot meet embed conventions, the
latter was a searched syntax-level lookup table. The 2D candidate screen is
kept because re-running it is expensive: 1,543 unimplemented pages intersected
with 567 two-dimensional-language pages, then filtered to 36 by implemented
verdicts, co-categories, I/O/branch vocabulary, and 1,500-character pages.
Super SNUSP and Alight were admitted; Pinyin was rejected.

## Specification decisions

- 6-5 accepts operands beyond its specification; generators use `0..35`.
- Jaune dispatch to an undefined marker is unspecified.
- Alight expressions are infix and left-to-right; three-argument `at` mutates.
- Packlang literals are decimal; its cat cannot receive byte 10 under
  line-oriented input.
- Pinyin is rejected: its spelling rule contradicts its examples and its
  input-1 truth-machine example has no deterministic reading.

Generated programs are evidence only after execution through their interpreter.
