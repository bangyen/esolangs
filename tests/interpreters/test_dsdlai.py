"""
Unit tests for DSDLAI (Dig straight down like an idiot) interpreter.

Tests cover DSDLAI's probabilistic death mechanism and example programs.
DSDLAI is a variant of Dig where there is a 20% to 90% chance for the program
to return an error when using the dig command, analogous to falling into lava
when digging straight down in Minecraft.

Based on the specification at https://esolangs.org/wiki/Dig_straight_down_like_an_idiot
